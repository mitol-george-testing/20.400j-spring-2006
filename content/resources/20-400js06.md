description: Actin-rich processes (light blue) in a transformed fibroblast protruding
  through extracellular matrix. The yellow spheres represent the centroids of beads
  added to the matrix to allow measurement of forces generated by the cell as it migrates
  through the 3D environment. The image shown is a wireframe representation of an
  isosurface rendering extracted from a time-resolved 3D series. (Image courtesy of
